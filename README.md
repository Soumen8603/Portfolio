Portfolio Website for Soumen Pal
This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential employers and collaborators. It's a single-page application built with modern web technologies, focusing on a clean aesthetic, dynamic animations, and a professional user experience.

Features
Modern & Clean UI: A dark-themed, minimalist design inspired by leading developer portfolios.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

Dynamic Animations:

Sections fade in gracefully as you scroll.

Interactive hover effects on buttons, links, and project cards.

A subtle pulsing animation on the hero section's subtitle to draw attention.

Sticky Navigation: The header appears on page load, hides on scroll down, and reappears on scroll up for easy navigation.

Interactive Experience Tabs: The "Where I've Worked" section features a clean tabbed interface to switch between roles.

Floating Social Links: Quick-access links to GitHub and LinkedIn are fixed on the side for desktop users.
